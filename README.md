# get-timezones-by-time
Created with CodeSandbox

This was a react component I used for a previous job where, as part of debugging gnarly timezone issues, I constantly needed up-to-date canonical IANA timezones that were in a particular time, e.g. 1 PM.

The search could probably be improved by sorting the timezone list by time, and then doing something like a binary search. However, at the time of creation I had to stop coding to make dinner and never came back to this.
